Implement lazy loading for MobileSidebar and Toaster components according to the plan in .claude/plans/staged-beaming-token.md

Key requirements:
- Only modify src/App.tsx (no changes to component files or barrel exports)
- Add lazy imports for MobileSidebar and Toaster components
- Wrap lazy components in Suspense boundaries with null fallbacks
- Make handleSelect async with dynamic import for showSelectionToast
- Add toastLoaded state to track when toast system should load

After implementation:
1. Run type check: bun run tsc
2. Run tests: bun test:run
3. Build production: bun run build
4. Verify bundle size reduction (target: 506 kB → ~450-470 kB)
5. Manual test on desktop and mobile viewports
